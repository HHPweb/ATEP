<h4><a id="at1" name="at1"></a>ATEP Overview</h4>

<p>The Athletic Training Education Program (ATEP) is a Commission on Accreditation of Athletic Training Education (CAATE) accredited undergraduate program. Upon completion of this degree, students will be eligible to sit for the Board of Certification exam, and eligible to work in the health care field with a physically active population. There is a strong clinical aspect of the program involving a minimum of 800 supervised hours under a certified athletic trainer. Admission to the university does not guarantee admission to the athletic training degree, as it is restricted by an imposed student-to-preceptor ratio.</p>

<p>In addition to other required classes, once in the major, students will enroll in clinical classes each semester and log a minimum of 200 supervised hours under a certified and licensed athletic trainer.</p>

<h4>ADMISSION</h4>

<p>Students who desire to enter the ATEP major must undergo a two-tier admittance procedure. When applying to ECU, interested students should indicate athletic training as their intended major, so they are assigned an advisor that will help them stay on track for the degree. After the first year of college, students qualified for the athletic training degree must apply for admission into the one-year Candidacy Period. The application and supporting materials can be found on the <a href="http://www.ecu.edu/cs-hhp/hlth/athletictr/athletetr.cfm">program website</a>.
   
<p><strong>Tier 1:</strong> To be considered for the Candidacy Period, students must have 24 credits of college course work, possess a minimum cumulative 2.75 GPA, and have completed BIOL 2140 and 2141, CHEM 1150 and 1151, ENGL 1100, HLTH 1000, KINE 2850, and PSYC 1000; each with a C (2.0) or better. Additionally students must provide evidence of 75 observation hours with a nationally certified and state licensed athletic trainer outside of ECU. A completed application packet (also including current first aid and adult, child and infant CPR certifications from an approved provider, two letters of character reference, signed ATEP Technical Standards, official transcripts from all college work, and verification of upholding ECU’s Student Code of Conduct, and Academic Integrity Code) is due no later than August 1 annually.</p>

<p><strong>Tier 2:</strong> Involves formal acceptance to the major, and occurs at the end of the one-year Candidacy Period (Tier 1) (typically, the end of the sophomore year). Applicants to Tier 2 must finish the Candidacy Period, complete a health screening, log 75 observation hours within the ECU ATEP, possess a minimum cumulative 2.75 GPA and have completed the following courses: ATEP 1800, 2800, 2810, 2811, BIOL 2150, 2151, NUTR 2105 and PHYS 1250, 1251; each with a C (2.0) or better. Qualified Candidates will have an interview with Program faculty and staff. Competitive admission is based June 2015 1 upon assessments of the applicant’s academic abilities, knowledge, dedication to the profession, and commitment to the health care of others. Transfer students are not admitted directly into the major, but those accepted into the University will have their transcripts reviewed by University Admissions, and may apply to the Candidacy Period if they meet the Tier 1 courses, GPA, observation and conduct requirements. No ATEP transfer courses will be accepted.</p>

<h4>REQUIREMENTS</h4>

<p>Athletic training students are required to earn a minimum course grade of C (2.0) in all athletic training courses. A minimum semester and cumulative GPA of 2.5 must be sustained throughout the program. All students in the degree are required to maintain TB status, varicella immunization, hepatitis B immunization (or waiver), and liability insurance for the duration of their involvement in the curriculum. Specific requirements are stated in the Athletic Training Student Handbook, and on the program website. The athletic training degree requires a minimum of 200 practical, supervised clinical hours each semester under the direction of a certified athletic trainer. The candidacy period does not count toward the total hours required.</p>
